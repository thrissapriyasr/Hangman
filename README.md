# Hangman-Game

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters in that word within a certain number of attempts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `hangman.py`, `hangman_words.py`, and `hangman_art.py` files.
2. Ensure you have Python installed.
3. Run the `hangman.py` file using a Python interpreter.

### How to Play

1. Run the `hangman.py` file.
2. The game will start by displaying a series of underscores representing the letters in the chosen word.
3. Guess a letter by typing it and pressing `Enter`.
4. If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, you'll lose a life.
5. Keep guessing letters until you either complete the word or run out of lives.

### Project Structure

- `hangman.py`: Contains the main game logic.
- `hangman_words.py`: Provides the word list for the game.
- `hangman_art.py`: Stores ASCII art used in the game.
